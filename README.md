## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **User Input:**
   - Enter the number of rows and columns for both matrices.
   - Fill in values for Matrix 1 and Matrix 2.

2. **Matrix Operations:**
   - **Addition** ➔ Element-wise sum of matrices.
   - **Multiplication** ➔ Element-wise product (**not** traditional matrix multiplication).
   - **Transpose** ➔ Rows and columns swapped for each matrix.

3. **Memory Management:**
   - Dynamic allocation using `new`.
   - Proper deallocation using `delete[]`.
