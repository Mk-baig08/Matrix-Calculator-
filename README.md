🧮 Matrix Calculator

A dynamic Matrix Calculator in C++ that can perform essential matrix operations:
➕ Addition, ✖️ Multiplication, and 🔄 Transposition.

🚀 Features
✅ Input two matrices of any size.

✅ Dynamically allocate and deallocate memory.

✅ Perform:

1) Matrix Addition

2) Matrix Multiplication (element-wise)

3) Matrix Transposition

✅ Clean and organized output display.

🛠️ How It Works
User Input:

Enter the number of rows and columns for both matrices.

Fill in values for Matrix 1 and Matrix 2.

Matrix Operations:

Addition ➔ Element-wise sum of matrices.

Multiplication ➔ Element-wise product (⚠️ Not true matrix multiplication).

Transpose ➔ Rows and columns swapped for each matrix.

Memory Management:

Dynamic allocation with new.

Proper deallocation with delete[].

🎯 Future Improvements
Implement true matrix multiplication.

Add matrix subtraction and division.

Handle non-square matrices more dynamically.
